## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'diegoedoolsapi'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install diegoedoolsapi

## Usage

To setup the gem, follow this steps:

- Configure token_master for requests like create a school. `Diegoedoolsapi.configuration.token_master = "{TOKEN HERE}"`
```
Example : `Diegoedoolsapi.configuration.token_master = "e1245wtyr23552353262623632:63634773474373723445"`
```

> **Note 1 :** **the token master is used only to create a new school, 
however it's mandatory to configure it.**

- If you don't want to put the token master to create a new school, simply set the token of an existing school using the following command:  `Diegoedoolsapi.configuration.token = "{SCHOOL TOKEN HERE}"`

```
Example: Diegoedoolsapi.configuration.token = "12345789346et9wrwyy:24567334778wejgke436
```
> **Note 2 :** **if you create a school, the token is automatically stored in your section to make other requests without having to configure it**
